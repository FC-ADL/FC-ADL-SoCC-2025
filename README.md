# FC-ADL: Efficient Microservice Anomaly Detection and Localisation Through Functional Connectivity

FC-ADL is an anomaly detection and root cause analysis approach for microservice faults. This repository includes the source code and notebooks to reproduce the experimental results of the paper "FC-ADL: Efficient Microservice Anomaly Detection and Localisation Through Functional Connectivity". All data used in the analysis can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fcadldata/fc-adl-dataset)
